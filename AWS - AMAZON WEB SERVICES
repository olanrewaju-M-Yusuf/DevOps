AWS - AMAZON WEB SERVICES
=========================
Cloud Service Provider:


You do not need to have on-prem (on-premises) resources: Servers, Routers, etc

Company A (TD Bank):
  Time: 8am - 10am = 1000k users
        10am - 2pm = 2000k users
        2pm - 6pm = 1500k users
        6pm - 11pm = 750k users

  Capex: = very high
  OpEx: = high


  Cloud providers: - eg AWS came into the picture
  Lots of headache associated with on-prem configurations have been taken care of.


  - Autoscaling is achieved

Week 1: - I need 10GB of storage
Week 2: - I now require about 100GB of storage
Week 3: - I no longer require any storage

Concepts in Cloud Services:
  1. IAAS: Infrastructure as a Service
     For eg; EC2 instance, EBS, S3 buckets
  2. PAAS: Platfrom as a Service
     For eg; EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) - AWS manages the master node / control plane
  3. SAAS: Software as a Service 
     For eg; MS 365, SonarCloud, Github, AWS Cloudwatch
---
  IAAC: - Infrastructure as a Code
     For eg: Terraform, Ansible, Cloudformation

AWS has:
  - Regions: (for eg; us-east-1)
    - Availability Zones (AZ): For eg; us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c

Considerations in creating resources in AWS:
  1. Pricing
  2. Latency
  3. Service availability
  4. Resource type
  5. User location
  6. Security and Compliance requirement in that area


Latency: This is the time/speed it takes a user to communicate with an application.
  - High Latency: higher communication time between a user and an app
  - Low Latency: <desired>

Types of Cloud Computing:
  - Public: AWS, GCP, MS Azure, IBM, Oracle, AliBaba
  - Private: on-prem
  - Hybrid: Combination of public and private cloud
  - Multi Cloud: For eg an organization utilizing the service of more than 1 cloud provider (eg AWS and GCP/MS Azure)


AWS:
  EC2: - Elastic Cloud Compute
  EBS: - Elastic Block Storage
  EFS: - Elastic File System
  S3 Bucket: - Simple Storage Service
  VPC: - Virtual Private Cloud;
      - Subnets
      - NAT Gateway,
      - IGW - Internet Gateway
      - Route Tables
      - etc
  ECR: - Elastic Container Registry
  IAM: - Identity and Access Management
  ELB: - Elastic Load Balancer
  ASG: - Auto Scaling Group
  Route53: 
  Cloudformation:

DNS: - Domain Name Service

172.10.12.14:80        www.facebook.com

DNS: ayodeji.com
CNAME: app.ayodeji.com ----> elb.hadcvkbiudslb.673256248498@elb:80 ----> 172.10.12.14:80


.............................
EC2: - Elastic Cloud Compute
-----------------------------
By default, an EC2 instance comes with an EBS volume / instance volume
- When the instance is terminated, by default, the default EBS volume gets terminated as well

If you create an EBS volume and attache it to an EC2 instance
- When the instance is terminated, the EBS volume remains (persistent)


Intance Pricing/Purchasing options:
  1. On demand
  2. Reserved
  -------dedicated host
  3. Spot
    - 70% usage capacity (USED)
    - 30% spare capacity
      - 10% can be placed as contingency
      - 20% goes into auction
        - ClientX - $5,000
        - ClientY - $9,000
        - ClientZ - $11,000 (Bid winner)

        - ClientW - $15,000 (New bid winner)

AMI: - Amazon Machine Image

IP Addressing:
  1. PrivateIP
     - This IP does not change .... it is permanent
  2. PublicIP
     - This changes when you terminate and restart an instance
  3. ElasticIP
     -  This makes the PublicIP permanent
